## @4fps/frame

Made with React and Storybook, this repository holds the 4fps Design System â€“ frame. To maintain a consistent design language, we use these components in our products. We are still transitioning to frame internally, which is why this is WIP.  

Use ``npm run storybook`` to browse the components locally.
To use them, install the package and include ``src/global.css`` in the header file.
